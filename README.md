## Goals

[Back to Contents](#contents)

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the current weather at my location so that I can quickly assess the conditions outside.
- As a user, I want to be alerted if I need specific items like an umbrella, suncream, or a jacket based on the weather forecast so that I can prepare appropriately before heading out.
- As a user, I want to receive suggestions for what to wear based on the weather, so I can dress comfortably for the day.
- As a user, I want to see hourly or daily weather forecasts so I can plan ahead for the day or week, ensuring I bring the right items.
- As a user, I want to have the option to enter a different location and get weather recommendations for that area, in case I’m traveling or want to check the weather elsewhere.
